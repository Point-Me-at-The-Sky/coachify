Choachify's mission statement is to provide AI solutions for simulating high stakes conversations

This repo contains the artifacts produced during the hackathon organized by Lablab.ai between 2025-02-14 and 2025-02-16
we used make.com to create two automation workflows, using the AI/ML API to provide deepseek models to analyze the calls

here are the links to the Demo websites:
In the first one you can have a sales call with a static agent who is heading the global data platform team in a swiss bank, you can 
train trying to sell her some SaaS solutions:
